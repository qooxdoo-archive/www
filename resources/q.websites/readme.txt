A custom q.core++ for our websites
===================================

Rather than using separate libs q.core + q.extras + ..., here is a custom q lib
which is taylor-made. Use `generate.py q-build-min` to create the q lib, and
`generate.py copy-to-resources` to copy all files directly to ../javascripts.
