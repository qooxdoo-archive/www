Resources of Project Website
============================

Resources (stylesheets, JS code, etc.) of the systems of our online presence 
(homepage, blog, issue tracker, news, resources, wiki, etc.).

The files in the various subsystems represent only those parts that were
tweaked/adapted for our needs. The original paths have been retained. But newer
versions of the subsystems might need them in a different path, under a
different name, or with different content.
